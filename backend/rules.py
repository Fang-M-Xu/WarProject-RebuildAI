style_guide = """Aim for clarity and simplicity. Follow Orwell’s rules: avoid clichés, use short words, cut unnecessary words, prefer active voice, avoid jargon, break rules if needed for clarity.

Use new metaphors; avoid worn-out ones. Prefer simple words (e.g., "use" over "utilize"). Avoid filler words ("really", "basically", etc.).

Acronyms: spell out first use, then abbreviate.

Punctuation: Use serial comma. Use commas before 'and/or' only for clarity.

Numbers: Spell out 1–9, use numerals for 10+. Use "$5 million", not "$5m". Write "5%", not "five per cent".

Dates: "June 29, 2011". Centuries: "21st century".

Titles: Mr./Ms. with surnames only. Dr. only for medical doctors. Don’t use titles with full names.

Quotes: Use “double” for direct speech, ‘single’ inside quotes. No quotes for indirect speech.

Italics: Use for book/film titles, ships, un-anglicized foreign words.

Capitalization: Use sparingly. Capitalize proper names, days, months, holidays, historic events.

Dashes: em dash (—) with spaces for breaks. en dash (–) for ranges. Hyphens for compound adjectives.

Common mix-ups: affect/effect, less/fewer, its/it’s, that/which, who/whom.

Avoid jargon: e.g., “leverage”, “paradigm shift”, “utilize”.

Be precise. If unsure, say so. Check facts.

Be consistent: spelling, punctuation, and style.

Cite sources and quote names and titles when relevant.

Writing improves with practice, reading, and feedback."""
